									<h2>Patrick Leonello</h2>
									<p>Patrick is 21 years old and was born in Australia. He is of Italian descent, and English is his primary language. Still, he can pick up some Italian from being around his Nonna (grandma), teaching her to use modern-day technology.
									Patrick graduated VCE from Loyola College Watsonia in 2017, then completed a certificate four and a diploma in screen and media, live production and Technical services in 2018-2019. Patrick enjoys creating and editing videos specifically; he enjoys the technical element of fluently putting together a coherent story that conveys emotion and a story from just raw footage. He has worked with Floorworld and AFLW star Monique Conti creating corporate style videos. Patrick has always been interested in pursuing Information Technology. Patrick is Interested in UCD (user-centred design). Developing applications and websites and combining different design elements and principles such as contrast, colour, typefaces can affect how the user interacts and feels and how that can influence their experience in positive and negative ways. In high school, Patrick always chose the I.T. and Computing subjects, where he learnt the basics of database management, web design, infographics, and a little bit of game development. Other than that, the first few weeks of the bachelor of information technology has been the bulk of Patrick I.T. experience learning the basics of programming using Python, management and development of databases, and user-centred design and web development using HTML.

Ben is now commencing his first year in a 3-year bachelor's degree in Information Technology. One of Ben's hobbies is PC hardware and Assembly. He enjoys looking into current PC companies and their hardware, like Ryzen and Intel CPU developers and Razer/ Corsair with their gaming peripherals. Ben's interest in IT began when he was 8 Years old through gaming which made him slowly more experienced and comfortable with IT systems and technology. There hasn't been any specific moment or person that sparked Ben's interests in IT; it was the collection of experiences with technology throughout his life that has led to IT. Technology is the main focus of his life choices. Ben has used many different consoles and technology, meaning he has experience in many operating systems and their many various errors and problems. Ben wants to learn more about IT to have a possible career in the field and know more about IT to assist him with different errors he could potentially run into in the future.

									<h2>Joshua Rowarth</h2>
									<p>After Joshua graduated from high school, he began an International Studies degree at Deakin University. Joshua's major was Chinese, and during the degree, he studied in Shanghai, China, for six months. After Joshua returned, he changed his degree to a business/international studies double degree. Still, he ultimately found that he didn't enjoy it and couldn't find many job opportunities. Joshua Has worked 28 different jobs since the age of 15, the most current and longest one being a bartender role. Joshua's Internet in IT began when he was younger; thanks to his favourite Properties such as Disney's Tron and the Digimon series, both had highly fantasized elements of tech. He enjoyed studying IT in secondary school but never continued because of advice from a careers adviser. His love for video games and attempting to learn the development of games helped direct him back to university to study IT. Recently Joshua has begun working on coding, app making, website-making, game making etc. He has always wanted to make video games and found more enjoyment with the code side than the actual game design part.

									<h1>Group processes</h1>
									<p>Overall, our group worked well together as we communicated efficiently and effectively. In Assignment 2 we had frequent group calls every week varying between 1-2. We discussed progression of tasks and helped each other if some tasks were taking longer than usual to complete. I believe that our communication skills were quite high tier as there was constant communication on different types of media, we used messenger groups and teams mainly to interact and share thoughts. We worked very well as a team, getting work done and not getting distracted in meetings. We shared work throughout the group and contribution was shared out as evenly as we could.
									<br>
								  </br>
									We all gelled very well together pretty much from the start with everyone talking in meetings and in the messenger group sharing ideas and thoughts. Each member was very supportive of other members if there were any times where something came up and the member could not attend a meeting or anything like that. Each individual team member gave updates on what they were up to in the work and estimates on completion times which made the timeline of work easily trackable.
