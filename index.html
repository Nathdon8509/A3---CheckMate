									<h2>Patrick Leonello</h2>
									<p>Patrick is 21 years old and was born in Australia. He is of Italian descent, and English is his primary language. Still, he can pick up some Italian from being around his Nonna (grandma), teaching her to use modern-day technology.
									Patrick graduated VCE from Loyola College Watsonia in 2017, then completed a certificate four and a diploma in screen and media, live production and Technical services in 2018-2019. Patrick enjoys creating and editing videos specifically; he enjoys the technical element of fluently putting together a coherent story that conveys emotion and a story from just raw footage. He has worked with Floorworld and AFLW star Monique Conti creating corporate style videos. Patrick has always been interested in pursuing Information Technology. Patrick is Interested in UCD (user-centred design). Developing applications and websites and combining different design elements and principles such as contrast, colour, typefaces can affect how the user interacts and feels and how that can influence their experience in positive and negative ways. In high school, Patrick always chose the I.T. and Computing subjects, where he learnt the basics of database management, web design, infographics, and a little bit of game development. Other than that, the first few weeks of the bachelor of information technology has been the bulk of Patrick I.T. experience learning the basics of programming using Python, management and development of databases, and user-centred design and web development using HTML.

									<p>Ben spent the first eight years of his education at Stella Maris Catholic Primary School in Burnie Tasmania, then spent the next six years at the sister school, Marist Regional College, where he finished grade 7 to grade 12. Ben is now commencing his first year in a 3-year bachelor's degree in Information Technology. One of Ben's hobbies is PC hardware and Assembly. He enjoys looking into current PC companies and their hardware, like Ryzen and Intel CPU developers and Razer/ Corsair with their gaming peripherals. Ben's interest in IT began when he was 8 Years old through gaming which made him slowly more experienced and comfortable with IT systems and technology. There hasn't been any specific moment or person that sparked Ben's interests in IT; it was the collection of experiences with technology throughout his life that has led to IT. Technology is the main focus of his life choices. Ben has used many different consoles and technology, meaning he has experience in many operating systems and their many various errors and problems. Ben wants to learn more about IT to have a possible career in the field and know more about IT to assist him with different errors he could potentially run into in the future.
